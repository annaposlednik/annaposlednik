### Climate Analysis
#### Patterns in annual snowfall at JFK Airport, NYC have not changed over time.

The interactive plot above is a great way to see which specific days had high snowfall in NYC. The highest peak of snowfall (30.3 inches) on January 23, 2016 broke records and resulted in  <a

The above graph provides annual average snowfall at JFK airport. The highest average snowfall occured in 2003 (0.17 inches), while 1973 and 2023 had the lowest annual average (0.006 in). No obvious linear trends are present in the above graph, and there is a lot of variability in the average annual snowfall from year to year. There is a suggestion in the graph that there are more extreme snowfall years (more high peaks) after 1990 vs before 1990, however further statistical analysis is needed. Because many daily values were 0, annual averages of snowfall may not be the most informative when analyzing changes in climate for this region. However, understanding how snowfall is changing over time at different locations around the world will provide more insight into the effects of climate change both locally and globally, as well as determine whether cyclic patterns exist in snowfall across decadal time scales.
